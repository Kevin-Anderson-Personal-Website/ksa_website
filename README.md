This is the personal website for Kevin Anderson

"Home" page features a picture of myself and my wife at the top of Half Dome at Yosemite National Park. One of the best days of my life

"About Me" page feature information about my personal life. This includes hobbies and family information. 

"Portfolio" page consists of made up stuff that I hope is true in the near future. A wise man once said "fake it till you make it"...not sure who that wise man is but here we are.
