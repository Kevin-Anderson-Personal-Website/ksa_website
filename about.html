            <h2 class="aboutsubhockey">Ice Hockey</h2>
                <h3 class="abouttexthockey">I started playing Ice Hockey with my older brother when I was 7 years old, in Phoenix, Arizona. <br>Hockey in the desert you ask? Yes, of course! <br>Let me ask you this...when it's 115 degrees outside, who wouldn't want to hang out in a giant walk in freezer!?! <br>What started as an after school activity to burn some energy turned into a long lasting love that continues to the present day. <br>I play on two adult-league teams as well as coach youth programs to help grow the game and share the enjoyment I so dearly benefited from. </h3>
            <h2 class="aboutsubfilmmaking">Filmmaking</h2>
                <h3 class="abouttextfilmmaking">I moved to Los Angeles in 2010 to pursue a career in filmmaking. <br>Started out at a camera rental house, networked and did my fair share of grinding, and became a freelance camera assistant. <br>After joining I.A.T.S.E. Local 600 (International Cinematographers Guild), my career and opportunities advanced progressively. <br>For a solid 8 years I worked as a 1st A.C., also known as a Focus Puller, and eventually worked my way up to Camera Operator. <br>I was fortunate enough to work on a variety of commercials, feature films, television shows, and an academy award winning documentary. <br>I had to make a tough decision to gracefully bow out of the industry to focus on my family. <br>It's an exciting industry but lacks sustainability, predictability, and is almost impossible to find a suitable work-life balance. <br>I'll always have a sweet spot in my heart for the filmmaking process!</h3>
